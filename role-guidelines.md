# 📌 DevSync Role Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all members holding special roles within DevSync, such as Scripters, Builders, UI Designers, and more. All role holders are expected to follow these rules to maintain fairness, professionalism, and trust within the community.

## 🔧 Scripter
- You must be able to write and understand clean, working Lua or Luau code (Roblox-specific).
- Use proper structure and avoid heavy reliance on free models or prebuilt systems.
- Must show examples of self-written scripts or systems (e.g., inventory, data saving, UI systems).
- **❌ Posting scripts not made by you will result in a warning and role removal.**

---

## 🏗️ Builder
- Must provide screenshots or in-game media of your original builds.
- Should demonstrate variety in styles (low-poly, realistic, stylized, etc.).
- Builds must be your own — stolen work or using uncredited assets is strictly prohibited.
- **❌ Using free models or claiming others' builds as yours will lead to immediate role removal.**

---

## 🖼️ UI Designer
- Must show custom-made user interface designs (screenshots, .psd, or .figma links).
- UI must be readable, properly aligned, and game-ready.
- Must be your own designs — using templates or copying others’ work is not allowed.
- **❌ Fake or copied UI submissions will result in a warning and removal.**

## 🎨 GFX Artist
- You must provide high-quality GFX renders or 2D edits created by you.
- Must have knowledge of lighting, posing, and composition (e.g., Blender or Photoshop).
- Credit any assets used (e.g., rigs or models that aren’t yours).
- **❌ Claiming marketplace GFX or others’ renders as your own will lead to role loss.**

## 🕺 Animator
- Submit animations created by you in Roblox Studio, Blender, or other tools.
- Must demonstrate fluid motion, transitions, and logical rig usage.
- Use of animation packs without credit or claiming premade ones is not allowed.
- **❌ Uploading stolen or pack animations = warning + role removal.**

## 🔊 Sound Designer
- Must provide original sound effects or background music (loops, effects, ambient).
- If collaborating with others, list your contributions clearly.
- Do not upload copyright or stock sounds without transformation or purpose.
- **❌ Submitting downloaded sounds as your work = instant warning.**

---

## 🧱 Modeler
- Models must be handcrafted (low-poly or high-poly), UV-mapped or Roblox-ready.
- Must provide screenshots or uploads proving you created them.
- Kitbashing is okay only if parts are credited and final work is yours.
- **❌ Reselling or claiming free/CC assets = permanent role removal.**

---

## 👑 Project Lead
- Should demonstrate experience leading full teams or projects.
- Must be active in hiring, coordinating, and planning.
- Provide links or references to past projects (games, teams, groups).

---

## 🧠 Full Developer
- Must show you can handle scripting + building (or other combos) alone.
- Show proof of finished games or systems fully made by you.
- Must maintain quality across multiple fields, not just basic work.
- **❌ Misusing this role or overpromising in posts = removal and possible warning.**

## 🚫 Consequences for Violations
- 1st offense: Warning + role removal  
- 2nd offense: Blacklist from holding roles  
- Severe offenses (scams, impersonation): Immediate ban  

All submitted work must be **original** and **traceable** to your account. Staff may ask for proof of creation at any time.
